### Overview
The Learncube Virtual Classroom API is used to create and schedule classes, enrol participants in classes and to set the default properties of a Learncube Virtual Classroom. 

<br />

### Classrooms
Each instance of the Learncube Virtual Classroom represents an individual class, with a unique id, start time, end time, and other properties that define what type of class it will be.

<br />

#### List Classrooms
Classrooms can be retrieved in a list or individually by providing the Learncube uuid.


```curl
# Fetch classroom list
GET https://api.learncube.com/api/virtual-classroom/classrooms/
